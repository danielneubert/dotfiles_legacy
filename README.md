# .dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles. These currently hold the files for these things:

- ~~Setting up `macOS`~~
- Setting up `wezterm` _(terminal emulator)_
- Setting up `fish` _(shell)_
- Setting up `starship` _(shell prompt)_
- Setting up `neovim` _(editor)_

## macOS Setup Script

> This part is currently wip and not yet public :-)

## Additional commands (fish aliases)

```sh
# Update homebrew, upgrade packages and clean homebrew up afterwards
> bup

# List all homebrew formulas without dependencies
> bls

# List all homebrew formulas with their dependencies
> blsa
```
